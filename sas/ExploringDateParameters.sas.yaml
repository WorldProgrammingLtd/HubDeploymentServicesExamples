  This example demonstrates use of date parameters.

  Dates have different representations in different
  programming languages. A client making a request
  to execute a program (be that programatically through
  something like cURL, or manually through an invocation
  user interface) shouldn't have to worry about those
  differences.

  The format of a date value on a request is therefore
  fixed and not dependent on the language in which the
  program may have been written.

parameters:
  dateRequired:
    label: Date Required
    datatype: date
    prompt: Enter a date
    required: true
  dateOptional:
    label: Date Optional
    datatype: date
    prompt: Enter a date
