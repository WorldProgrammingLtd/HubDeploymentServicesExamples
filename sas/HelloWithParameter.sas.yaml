  Here we make things very slightly more complicated,
  and useful, by adding a parameter. When the program is invoked
  through a user interface such as the Microsoft Excel plugin,
  the user will be prompted for the value of the parameter.

  A parameter has a name. This is the internal name for the
  parameter, the name by which you refer to the parameter within
  the program. It then also has a label which is the string used
  in a user interface to refer to the parameter. There is then a
  prompt string, which is the string used to prompt the end user
  for a value of the parameter.

  A parameter can be optional, but here we make the parameter
  required to ensure that the end user provides a value for it.
  The runtime server will reject a request that doesn't include
  a value for the parameter.
parameters:
  name:
    label: Name
    datatype: string
    prompt: Enter a Name
    required: true
