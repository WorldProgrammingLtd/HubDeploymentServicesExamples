# This descriptor is only really necessary because we
# are wanting to provide a label and some categories.
# With no package descriptor file the label would be
# the filename of the program, minus any extension
# or path information, and the program would be published
# with no categories (assuming it's included in the list
# of programs to be published)
label: PKGSAS01 - Hello World
categories:
- Example
- SAS Language Example
- Package Example
