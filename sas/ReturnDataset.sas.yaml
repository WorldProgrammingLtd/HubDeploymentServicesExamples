  This example demonstrates the other style of output
  offered by a standard program. We can directly
  return a data set. All we need to do is name
  the data set to return and the format of output
  that we want and the framework takes care of the
  conversion for us. We can return data sets in
  XML (resultFormat=xml), JSON (resultFormat=json)
  or CSV (resultFormat=csv). Here we use JSON.

  To use this functionality, resultType has to be set to
  'dataset', and the resultDatasetName property has to be
  supplied. This is the name of a dataset in normal
  'library.member' format.

  In this example we construct a simple data set
  and return it.
resultType: dataset
resultFormat: json
resultDatasetName: WORK.example
