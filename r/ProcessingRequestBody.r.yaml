description: |
  For advanced scenarios it's possible to get direct
  access to the body of the HTTP request, and process the
  body directly. This may be necessary if the body is a JSON or
  XML body with a complex structure, or perhaps if the body is
  of a content type not otherwise supported by Hub Deployment Services.

  To do this, declare a single parameter of type "stream".
  The stream should be given a content type value.
  If the content type of the request matches the content type
  of the stream, then the request body is made available to the program
  through the named stream parameter.

  Note that this example cannot be invoked using the invocation interface
  in the Hub portal, nor from the Excel plugin. To invoke this example
  you need to use something like cURL, or Postman.

parameters:
  webin:
    datatype: stream
    contentType: text/plain
resultType: stream
