  This example demonstrates using stream output to deal
  with cases that cannot be dealt with by returning an
  R object directly.

  Here we use it to specify the `pretty` option when
  converting an R object to JSON.

  An R *connection* object is created called 'webout'.
  A connection object in R can be used anywhere a file
  can bs used.

  On the 'Inputs & Output' tab of the program definition,
  the 'Output type' is set to 'stream'. Since we are returning
  JSON, we then set the 'Output format' field to JSON.
resultType: stream
resultContentType: application/json
