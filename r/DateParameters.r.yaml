  This example demonstrates use of date parameters.

  Dates have different representations in different
  programming languages. A client making a request
  to execute a program (be that programatically through
  something like cURL, or manually through an invocation
  user interface) shouldn't have to worry about those
  differences.

  The format of a date value on a request is therefore
  fixed and not dependent on the language in which the
  program may have been written.

  The HTTP query parameters are converted from strings to
  date values by first using `as.numeric` to convert the
  value into a numeric, then using the `as.Date` function.

resultFormat: print
resultObjectName: result

parameters:
  dateRequired:
    label: Date Required
    datatype: date
    prompt: Enter a date
    required: true
  dateOptional:
    label: Date Optional
    datatype: date
    prompt: Enter a date
