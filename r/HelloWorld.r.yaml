  This is the simplest possible example, a program
  that takes no input and produces a fixed output,
  'Hello World!'.

  By default the result that is returned is the value of
  an R object, converted into text in one of a number of
  ways: JSON (resultFormat=json), CSV (resultFormat=csv),
  tab (tab separated, resultFormat=tab) and print (standard
  R print format, resultFormat=print). Here we use JSON.
  The object to return is named in the resultObjectName
  property.

  R objects are always arrays, so in the case of returning
  JSON, you will always get a JSON array. In this case
  the R object is a vector, so the output is an array of
  strings.

  The R object is converted to JSON using the jsonlite package,
  invoking `jsonlite::toJSON`
